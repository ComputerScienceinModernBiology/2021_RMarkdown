We will be performing Exercise 1 for the CompSciBio Workshop course titled: R Markdown

Our aim is to answer three questions using data on the turtle _Chrysemis picta_ from the paper:

> Lisa E. Schwanz, Rachel M. Bowden, Ricky-John Spencer, and Fredric J. Janzen. 2009. Nesting ecology and offspring recruitment in a long-lived turtle. Ecology 90:1709.

## Loading packages

With the following chunk of code we will be loading the required packages and functions we will use through the analysis process

```{r Loading Packages}
library(tidyverse)
```
## Loading data

With the following chunk, we are reading the data into R

```{r Loading data}
turtles <- read.delim("Data/data.txt")

```

We notice that some of the last rows in the dataframe are empty, just filled with NAs. Now we can clean this from the dataset

```{r Cleaning data}
head(turtles)
tail(turtles)

turtles <- turtles[complete.cases(turtles), ]

#### dplyr option
#turtles <- turtles %>% 
#    filter(complete.cases(.))

tail(turtles)
```

# Data Analysis

## Question 1: Did the number of nest studied change by year?

To answer this question, we will proceed to make a frequency table of nests by year. And then plot it in a barplot.

```{r Q1 Frequency table}
table(turtles$Year)
```
We see that the frequency table is already ordered. We will proceed to store this object into R and plot it using ggplot2 library from tidyverse.

```{r Q1 Barplot}
table(turtles$Year) %>%
    data.frame(.) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Var1, y = Freq)) +
    geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
    theme_bw() +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Nests")
```

The last step is to save the plot into the figures table, not only displaying it in the markdown result

```{r Q1 Figure Output}
png("Figures/Q1_Nests_Per_Year.png", width = 1000, height = 600)
table(turtles$Year) %>%
    data.frame(.) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Var1, y = Freq)) +
    geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
    theme_bw() +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Nests")
dev.off()
```

## Question 2: Was there a difference in clutch size between the years covered by the study?

We have different ways to address this question graphically. The first we thought about was to use boxplots

```{r Q2 Plot}
turtles %>%
    filter(Clutch_Size != -999.9) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = factor(Year), y = Clutch_Size)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    theme_bw() +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Clutch Size (# Eggs)")
```

We can observe that the average number of eggs per nest seems to be stable through time. Further statistical tests may provide better insights on this observed trend.

```{r Q2 Figure output}
png("Figures/Q2_ClutchSize_Per_Year.png", width = 1000, height = 600)
turtles %>%
    filter(Clutch_Size != -999.9) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = factor(Year), y = Clutch_Size)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    theme_bw() +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Clutch Size (# Eggs)")
dev.off()
```

We will be performing Exercise 1 for the CompSciBio Workshop course titled: R Markdown

Our aim is to answer three questions using data on the turtle _Chrysemis picta_ from the paper:

> Lisa E. Schwanz, Rachel M. Bowden, Ricky-John Spencer, and Fredric J. Janzen. 2009. Nesting ecology and offspring recruitment in a long-lived turtle. Ecology 90:1709.

## Loading packages

With the following chunk of code we will be loading the required packages and functions we will use through the analysis process

```{r Loading Packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(reticulate)
py_discover_config() # We can check what python version will be used
#py_install("pandas")
```
## Loading and cleaning data using Python

With the following chunk, we are reading the data into R

```{python Loading data}
import pandas
turtles = pandas.read_csv("Data\data.txt", sep = "\t")
turtles
```

Now we can clean the dataset

```{python Cleaning data}
turtles = turtles.dropna()
turtles
```

# Data Analysis - Cleaning with python, plotting with R

## Question 1: Did the number of nest studied change by year?

To answer this question, we will proceed to make a frequency table of nests by year. And then plot it in a barplot.

```{python Q1 Frequency table}
pandas.crosstab(index=turtles['Year'], columns='count')

nestyears = pandas.crosstab(index=turtles['Year'], columns='count')
```
We see that the frequency table is already ordered. We will proceed to store this object into R and plot it using ggplot2 library from tidyverse.

```{r Q1 Barplot}
py$nestyears %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = rownames(.), y = count)) +
    geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
    theme_bw() +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Nests")
```

The last step is to save the plot into the figures table, not only displaying it in the markdown result

```{r Q1 Figure Output}
png("Figures/Q1_Nests_Per_Year.png", width = 1000, height = 600)
py$nestyears %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = rownames(.), y = count)) +
    geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
    theme_bw() +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Nests")
dev.off()
```

## Question 2: Was there a difference in clutch size between the years covered by the study?

We have different ways to address this question graphically. The first we thought about was to use boxplots

```{python Removing -999.9 values from clutch size}
filtered_turtles = turtles[turtles['Clutch_Size'] != -999.9]

```


```{r Q2 Plot}
py$filtered_turtles %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = factor(Year), y = Clutch_Size)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    theme_bw() +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Clutch Size (# Eggs)")
```

We can observe that the average number of eggs per nest seems to be stable through time. Further statistical tests may provide better insights on this observed trend.

```{r Q2 Figure output}
png("Figures/Q2_ClutchSize_Per_Year.png", width = 1000, height = 600)
py$filtered_turtles %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = factor(Year), y = Clutch_Size)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    theme_bw() +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Clutch Size (# Eggs)")
dev.off()
```

<p align="center"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">INTRODUCTION</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For long-lived
  animals, early-life stages are often considered to be minor components of
  population demography, with the assumption that the performance of advanced
  juveniles and reproductive-aged individuals contributes more to population
  structure (e.g., Crouse et al 1987; Heppell et al 1996; Heppell 1998). Despite
  this assumption, few long-term data are available to test whether variation and
  temporal fluctuations in the vital rates of early life stages play a
  substantive role in population dynamics (Dutton et al 2005; Spencer and
  Thompson 2005; Wisdom et al 2000). In addition, if the recruitment of
  early life stages is affected by maternal reproductive behavior, natural
  selection on the reproductive success of individuals could alter reproductive
  behavior and, thereby, population dynamics. Maternal reproductive behavior
  influences offspring phenotype in many animals, which may have fitness
  consequences for both mothers and offspring (Deeming and Ferguson 1991;
  Bernardo 1996; Gagliano and McCormick 2006; Marshall and Uller 2007; Mousseau
  and Fox 1998<i>a,b</i>; Räsänen and Kruuk 2007). For animals that terminate maternal
  care at egg deposition, maternal provisioning of eggs and nest characteristics
  such as temperature, moisture, and pH, can influence embryonic growth,
  morphology and viability (Deeming and Ferguson 1991). In addition, incubation
  temperature determines embryonic sex in many long-lived reptiles
  (temperature-dependent sex determination, TSD; Bull 1980, Janzen and Paukstis
  1991). Furthermore, the timing of nesting and nest-site selection may influence
  depredation and parasitism rates. Thus, maternal nesting ecology and hatchling
  recruitment may be more influential in population dynamics than previously
  thought. Little is known about long-term patterns in the nesting ecology of
  populations of long-lived vertebrates, and as a consequence, we have a limited
  understanding of natural fluctuations in population demography and the
  consequences of such fluctuations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We have been
  monitoring a population of painted turtles (<i>Chrysemys picta</i>) in
  Illinois, USA, for 18 years in an effort to better understand the ecology,
  evolution and demographic consequences of maternal nesting behavior (i.e.,
  timing of nesting and nest-site selection) and temperature-dependent sex
  determination on offspring phenotype. The population of painted turtles used
  for this ongoing long-term project was studied at one major nesting beach
  (41°57' N, 90°07' W) along the backwaters of the Mississippi River near
  Thomson, Illinois, USA. Painted turtles are an aquatic species that nests in large numbers
  on nesting beaches at our study site. They dig shallow nests that contain 3–21
  eggs per clutch (mean = 10.5, mode = 10), and females may deposit up to three
  separate nests during a single nesting season in this area. Hatchling painted
  turtles remain in the nest for winter hibernation and emerge the following
  spring (Weisrock and Janzen 1999).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Data were
  collected to examine the role of nesting phenology, nest-site selection,
  depredation rates, and clutch success on hatchling recruitment. The site was
  monitored daily for the duration of the nesting season between 1989 and 2006.
  We excavated nests in the fall of each year to determine nest survivorship.
  These efforts provided data for each nest describing date of laying, vegetation
  cover, depredation, and hatchling survival. For a subset of the nests, clutch
  size was also known. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Portions of these
  data have been used to address numerous ecological and evolutionary questions.
  Data for onset and duration of the nesting season have provided the starting
  point for computer simulations and empirical assessments of the biotic impact
  of climate warming on populations of turtles with temperature-dependent sex
  determination (TSD; Janzen 1994<i>a</i>; Morjan 2003<i>a, b</i>; Schwanz and Janzen 2008).
  Female turtles have been shown to demonstrate repeatability in selection of
  nest vegetation cover (Janzen and Morjan 2001). In addition, nest vegetation
  cover has been shown to be spatially autocorrelated and to influence nest
  temperature and sex ratio (Janzen 1994<i>b</i>; Valenzuela and Janzen 2001). Portions
  of the data set have also been used to show that depredation is a strong
  component of nest survival (up to 95.8% nest depredation in a year), and is
  nonrandom with respect to nest location (Kolbe and Janzen 2002). Moreover, the
  probability of nest depredation is influenced by the nature of precipitation
  events, with heavy rain on the day of nest construction reducing the frequency
  with which nests are destroyed by predators (Bowen and Janzen 2005). These
  studies have made valuable contributions to our understanding of the ecology
  and evolution of nest-site selection, yet many questions remain. We intend for
  the data provided here to be used by researchers to explore such issues in
  greater detail and by teachers to illustrate the linkage between maternal
  behavior, offspring recruitment, and population dynamics of a globally
  imperiled taxon. </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Abstract:</font></b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The role of early life
  stages (eggs, neonates, and juveniles) for population persistence in long-lived
  organisms is thought to be minor. However, few long-term data sets are
  available to test this assumption. Variation in vital rates over space and time
  and the potential for the success of early life stages to shape adult
  reproductive behavior evolutionarily suggest that more thorough consideration
  of these life stages is necessary. In particular, the impact of climatic
  variation on early life-stage recruitment is not well understood. Furthermore,
  predation occupies a significant role in theoretical models of population
  dynamics, but its impact on populations through variable vital rates of
  early life stages is unknown. Maternal nest site selection, an important
  component of nesting ecology, may influence many offspring traits and respond
  to selection to optimize offspring success. Overall, we have limited
  information regarding the long-term patterns of natural fluctuations in the
  nesting ecology and hatchling recruitment of populations of long-lived
  organisms.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The research site for this ongoing long-term
  project is on an island (41°57' N, 90°07' W) in the Mississippi River near
  Thomson, Illinois, USA. Painted turtles (<i>Chrysemys picta</i>) have been studied
  extensively at this location since 1989 to examine the ecology and potential
  demographic consequences of nest-site selection and depredation, with the aim
  of understanding the evolution of maternal nesting behavior and its effects on
  offspring phenotype. We monitored the site every day of the nesting season each
  year to record nesting and depredation events. The data presented here include
  nesting phenology, nest vegetation cover, total number of nesting events,
  clutch size, depredation, and hatchling survival.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Portions of this data set have been used to address
  related questions in ecology and evolutionary biology. In particular, climatic
  variation influences the probability of nest depredation events. Such events
  are typically nonrandom, primarily occurring adjacent to habitat edges. Because
  habitat edges may have atypical vegetation composition and vegetation
  influences nest temperature, such nonrandom depredation could influence
  offspring recruitment and, hence, population structure. Given the unique scope
  and accessibility of this data set, researchers and teachers should find it to
  be a valuable empirical resource for exploring important facets of nesting
  ecology and hatchling recruitment in a wild population of a long-lived species.</font></p>

  Thomson) elevated the Mississippi River, isolating the site from mainland
  Illinois. In the early 1960s, the field
  site was partially cleared to develop a recreation area. Portions of the
  nesting beach were covered with blacktop and developed with underground piping
  and electricity to designated campsites in 1983.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Climate:</font></b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The site experiences typical climate for the midwest USA. January air
  temperatures average -2.0/-11.9°C and July air temperatures average 29.7/15.6°C.

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Design
  characteristics:</font></b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The sampling regime was designed to record the majority of
  painted turtle nesting events at South Potter’s Marsh. Annual sampling periods
  encompassed the nesting season (late May to early July), providing data on
  nesting phenology. Hourly monitoring between sunrise and sunset was adequate to
  detect the majority of nesting events, while not producing excessive
  disturbance to nesting females. Females often produce two clutches in a year. </font></p>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Data collection
  period: </font></b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We monitored the nesting beach annually between 1989 and 2006 from
  mid-May until early July (spring sampling period). Most turtles nest in June,
  so this period encompasses the annual nesting season of painted turtles at this
  site. During this sampling period, the site was monitored hourly from sunrise
  to sunset every day for the presence of nesting female turtles (except for
  1990, 1991, and 1994, which had more sporadic checks for visually-recognizable
  nests). Nests were checked every three days during the spring-summer sampling
  period for depredation events. Eggs hatch roughly 2–3 months after they are
  laid and the hatchlings remain in the nests for winter hibernation. The fall
  sampling period consisted of the third weekend in September every year. During
  this period, all nests that were not known to be depredated (active nests) were
  relocated and excavated. </font><br>
  <b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">3. Research methods:</font></b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Every day during the spring-summer sampling period,
  the site was monitored hourly between sunrise and sunset for nesting painted
  turtles. All observed nests were recorded. Once a female completed her nest,
  the nest location was mapped by triangulating (nearest cm) with respect to
  permanent local landmarks. In addition, numbered markers were placed above the
  nest neck. Vegetation cover above each nest was recorded using a spherical
  densiometer for each of the four cardinal directions (Janzen 1994<i>b</i>, Weisrock
  and Janzen 1999). A subset of nests was excavated to count eggs. This
  monitoring provided data on the total number of nests completed, the seasonal
  phenology of nesting activity, nest-site characteristics (i.e. vegetation cover
  and location), and clutch size. Nests were subsequently monitored during the
  spring-summer sampling period for depredation events. Nest depredation on the
  Thomson Causeway was largely attributed to raccoons and was easily detected as
  there was an empty hole in the ground where the nest was located. Numbered
  markers were frequently recovered from the predation hole. In the absence of
  this direct evidence of the nest identity, the predated nest was distinguished
  from any nearby intact nests by confirming that nearby nests retained their
  markers above undisturbed soil or by using our nest measurements to confirm
  nest locations. Nest monitoring provided data on the depredation of each nest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">During the fall
  sampling period, we relocated and excavated all active nests. The live hatchlings
  from each nest (0–16 hatchlings per nest; mean = 2.9, mode = 0) were counted
  and placed together in a plastic container and transported to Iowa State
  University. A subset of the hatchlings was sacrificed for the determination of
  sex. The remaining hatchlings were maintained in the laboratory over the winter
  under naturalistic conditions and released at the Thomson Causeway the
  following May. This sampling provided data on final nest depredation, nest
  survival and hatchling survival.</font></p>

  verification:</font></b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The data in the data set were verified by confirming the
  accuracy of the original digital data entries of individual nests. This was
  done in the following manner. Nests were counted in a year if the original data
  sheets confirmed that the nest was real and unique. Nesting dates were
  confirmed randomly for each year (3–5% of nests checked). For nests that lacked
  nesting dates in the digital data files, the original data sheets were
  consulted and these data were entered into the data file when available. All
  original data entries of depredation events, nest survival, and number of live
  hatchlings were confirmed by comparing entered data with hand-written data on
  the original data sheets. Nests were counted as depredated if the data sheet
  indicated a depredation event, if the nest was empty during the fall sampling
  period, or if the data sheet did not indicate a fate, but no hatchlings or eggs
  were recovered from the nest. In some years, a portion of the nests was
  protected against depredation with subsurface metal grates. These nests were
  counted as depredated if digging marks of predators were present at the nest.
  These events were counted as depredation because, under normal situations,
  those nests would have been consumed. Any hatchlings produced by these nests
  were not included in the data set. Nests were counted as surviving if at least
  one live hatchling was recovered from the nest. Counts of live hatchlings in a
  nest excluded dead eggs and late-stage embryos. The original nest data have
  also been checked multiple times previously during the course of preparing
  publications using nest data (see below).</font></p>

  anomalies:</font></b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> In 1993, the entire research site was flooded prior to
  depredation counts. For this reason, no data are available for 1993 on nest
  depredation. No nests survived in 1993 (all excavated nests had dead eggs). In
  all years, nests outside of South Potter’s Marsh were also recorded and
  numbered, but are not included in this data set. For a few nests, a greater
  number of live hatchlings were excavated in the fall than the number of eggs
  that had previously been recorded during spring-summer excavation. We assume,
  in these cases, that some eggs were overlooked during initial nest excavation
  in the spring-summer.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">D. Computer
  programs and data processing algorithms:</font></b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Nests located outside of South
  Potter’s marsh were removed from the dataset. Nesting date in Julian days was
  calculated from the record of the calendar date of nesting (or nesting window),
  taking into account leap years. Vegetation cover data were processed from raw
  densiometer readings into percentage cover. Previous analyses have indicated
  that vegetation cover in the southern and western directions are most important
  in determining nest temperature and clutch sex ratio (Janzen 1994<i>b</i>, Morjan and
  Janzen 2003, Weisrock and Janzen 1999). South and west vegetation cover
  readings from the densiometer were multiplied by 1.04 to calculate percentage
  vegetation cover in those directions. These values were summed using the “sum”
  function of excel to calculate S+W Vegetation cover. In 2004 and 2005,
  vegetation cover was measured using a spherical lens on a digital camera. These
  digital images provide measures of transmitted solar radiation, which can be
  converted back to S+W Vegetation cover by a simple linear equation (verified
  from data of digital images and densiometer readings collected in 2003; Kasuga
  et al unpubl.)</font></p>

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

Notice that you can render the document in the *Viewer* pane, or in a full window.

# Format

Markdown is a lightweight markup language. This means that we apply format to text using a set of characters, making the process easy to perform on any text editor.

## Headings

We can use # before the text to indicate it is a title

# This is heading
## Subheading
### Smaller
###### Up to six levels
Compare this with regular font

## Emphasis

We can use * and _ to bold and italicize text

I just love **bold text**, sometimes *italics*, but rarely ***both together***

Wen can also use _one underscore_,  __two__, and even ___three___

Bold and Italic Best Practices

Markdown applications donâ€™t agree on how to handle underscores in the middle of a word. For compatibility, use asterisks to bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis.

# Equations

We can also add nicely formatted equations using the $ symbol.

$2+2$

The regression had a $R^{2} = 0.85$

$\text{We can add text inside the equation: } A \times B$

# Structure for Reproducible Analysis in Rmd

We can use markdown notebooks to build a reproducible analysis. The idea behind this compendium is preparing a more or less standardized set of files and directories that can be executed for any third-party so they will be able to obtain the same results. The suggested minimal structure: 

- **Project directory**: The main project directory should contain an **.Rproj** file and the **R markdown notebook**.
  - **data**: subdirectory where the data is located
  - **figures**: subdirectory where the output figures are located

In general terms, the structure must contain **input** and **output** folders. In the previous example, these folders are represented by *data* and *figures*, but our output in other cases may be more than only figures. 

Another extra folder for **analysis** or **scripts** can be added, containing solely R, Python, or other languages' scripts that are required to run the process.

The **R markdown notebook** (or **.Rmd file**) will contain the pipeline of analysis, including:
    - Loading the libraries required for analysis
    - Loading the external functions, if an analysis or scripts folder exist
    - Loading the data, contained in the input or data folders
    - Performing the analysis itself
    - Creating the output, displaying it and/or saving the results in the output or figures folder

Regardless, this framework for reproducible research is supposed to be versatile and adaptable to the specifics of our project. Don't be afraid to change it in a way that makes sense to you, while keeping it organized for other people to run the process.
